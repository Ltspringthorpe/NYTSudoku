# NYTSudoku
Code snippet for NYT Sudoku puzzles

#### Details
Adds highlighting to the New York Times sudoku puzzles (when viewed on the website).
When you select a square with a number in it, all the other squares in the grid with that number are highlighted.
This is a feature that exists in the LA Times sudoku puzzles, but is amiss in NYT.

#### Usage
Open the page's console. (If you don't know how to access a page's console, you probably shouldn't be copying and pasting strange scripts from the internet.)
Copy this script and paste it into the console. Hit enter. Play the puzzle like normal. Ta-da!
